Description of Project:
This project calcualtes the time needed to travel between two buildings on the UCSB campus. Transportation methods are walking and biking, more may be implemented later (such as 747 airplane)

USER STORIES:

As a user, I can determine how long it would take for me to bike  from one building to another 
As a user, I can determine how long it would take for me to walk  from one building to another 

USEABILITY:
As it is, the software compiles and can run, but throws an exception 

POTENTIAL USER STORIES:
1.As a user, I can determine the distance between two buildings on campus

2. As a user, I can calculate the time neccesary to travel between classes at more than two buildings on campus

3. As a user I can determine the time neccesary to travel to locations in Isla Vista, such as Freebirds, 67 Block of Del Playa, or other locations such as the airport or Downtown SB 

4. As a user, I could determine how fast I could travel using other modes of transportation, such as skateboard, car, running, scooter, those fancy hoverboard-things that now exist 

5. If it is currently class-changing time ( ie.  xx:50 o'clock), as a User I will be warned of potential traffic on bike paths

6. determine if the calculated path is has a no-bike/no-skateboard section

7. Some buildings cannot be directly biked to, such as buchanan, ellison hall, these require a combo of walking/biking


Current READ.me:

The current READ.me explains the purpose of the program, but should include things that are neccesary for it to run, such as the URL that the building codes are kept at (incase building codes change, or buildings are added to campus)

Current Build.xml:

The run path needs to include the correct path to run the file
Removed old code that was for Mantis


Code assesment:

As it is, the file contains two methods, Main and Go(), which I beleive could be  broken up into methods such as getLong, getLat, calcDist, etc. As it is these are all contained in those two methods. There is also unneccessary blank space between try/catch blocks, closing braces, etc. There is no practice of data hiding, no use of classes, private/ public variables. There are no test cases at all for the distances between buildings, calculated time for walking or biking. As it is, the code is pretty clear in what is being done, but I believe it could be cleared up a bit by breaking it up into appropriate methods, classes ('Building' class with parameters such as a latitude, longtitude, building code, building name, etc), and appropraite comments. 





Issues:
-URL for building codes no longer exists, working URL with building codes is:
http://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/locationcodes.aspx

-Build.xml run target does not have correct file path

-No test coverage 

-Main method has all code, none of it is broken up into seperate methods
